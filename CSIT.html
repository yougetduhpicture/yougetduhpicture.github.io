<h4 class="h2">Assignment Description</h4>
    <p class="p">
        On Digital Project Course, we did a commission given by CSIT Oy. 
        CSIT Oy is a Finnish company specializing in digital healthcare solutions. 
        Our commission was to create a login portal for their information management service for hospital personnel. 
        The goal was also to create working design and front- and back-end. The company was to use the student’s designs as a basis when creating the actual portal. 
    </p>
    <div class="mx-5">
      <img src="IMAGES/CSIT/Loginportal view2.jpg" class="profile"> 
     </div>
    <h4 class="h2">Tools</h4>
    <p class="p">We used Teams for group’s filesharing, Zoom for meetings, Trello for Scrum, Miro for planning and organising the information, and WhatsApp for quick communication.
        Prototype was done using Axure, the Front end was done using React and the Back-end with Postman.
        </p>
    <h4 class="h2">Benchmark</h4>
        <p class="p">We looked such as Finnish HSL-app’s and Sanoma Pro’s login interfaces. 
            Especially HSL-app’s interface and features were highly inspirational for our final product.</p>

    <h4 class="h2">Designing the front-end and wireframing</h4>
    <p class="p">Our process was quite straightforward.
        We figured out together with the team which features were to be in the final product. 
        After that Pablo and I had a session, in which we did the wireframe for the front end. We sketched the frames with pen and paper.
         We started the creation process with creating a page chart. We made sense of which features went on which page. 
         Went through each user path and figured out how they would end. 
         After we had a rough page chart done, we worked on each page individually, figured out where there should be popups, and which page lead to which page. 
        We filled the paths and the pop-ups also to the page chart. </p>

    <h4 class="h2">Prototype</h4>
    <p class="p">After we went through the wireframes with group Tanja, and I set out to create the prototype using Axure. 
        We created the prototype using the CSIT brand guide provided. After we’d made the prototype. 
        We had a few minor details like pop-ups and such we had to sacrifice when making prototype, but overall, the prototype turned out good. 
        Pablo did some final fixes to colours since he had more experience on the matter, he’d gained doing fashion design. </p>

<a class="p" href="https://7be1ha.axshare.com/#id=ocpmry&p=login">Go to prototype</a>

<h4 class="h2">User Testing</h4>
<p class="p">I had a few people try out the prototype. They had three missions:</p>
<ul class="p">
    <li>Modify the user information.</li>
    <li>Request for modification in employment information.</li>
    <li>Request the deletion of account.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">
    All the test subjects were successful with the missions, but ¾ of them had problems recognising the modifiable fields, so we decided to make the fields more modifiable looking by changing the colour. 
Now that I think of it in retrospect, I should have interviewed people who were in the health care industry but given the fact that the whole project was done during the Autumn of 2020 I concider it a miracle, that I got any people to try the portal (the raging Covid-19 pandemic was making it hard).

<h4 class="h2">Front-end and Back-end</h4>
<p class="p">Tanja created the front-end and Sonja created the back end. 
    We were not able to connect them even though they worked fine separately. </p>

    <h4 class="h2">Feedback</h4>
    <p class="p">
        Overall CSIT and our teacher were rather impressed and pleased with the results we had when the course came to an end. With the CSIT representative stating that we should start an UX consulting firm.
